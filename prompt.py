Does this provided image (e.g., invoice, receipt, delivery note) have a seal or a handwritten signature? 

Handwritten Signatures:
 -Only recognize handwritten signatures, not typed words.

Seals or Stamps:
- Faint or faded markings: Seals or stamps applied with low ink or that have faded over time.
- Blurry or smudged imprints: Seals that are unclear due to movement or poor application.
- Obscured markings: Seals partially covered by text, signatures, folds, or other elements.
- Unusual orientations: Seals that are upside down, reversed, or partially cropped.
- Different colors or textures: Even light, dull, or more faded seals that blend into the background.


Follow these rules carefully:
1. **Ignore the logo: The document may have an "OASIS" logo in the corners. This is NOT a seal or stamp. Do NOT count it.** 
2. **Ignore typed placeholders** in signature fields (like "h", "x", "bbb", "mn") may look like handwriiten but they were not. Only consider actual handwritten marks made by a pen or similar writing instrument.  
3. **Ignore any letters on the Signature Name section that are not a real signature.**
4. **Ignore any printed initials or names, even if they appear near the signature line.**
5. **Please ignore any signs of torn, damaged, or faded paper that might resemble a seal or stamp. Only mark a seal or stamp as present if it is clearly an intentional seal or stamp.**
6. Only identify items that are clearly:
   - A handwritten signature (cursive, printed by hand, or initialed by a human)  
   - A stamp or seal that is part of the document's official validation (ink, embossed, or printed in a way that is not just a logo)  

Scan All Areas: Seals and signatures may be located anywhere on the document — near the bottom, top, margins, or even over printed text. Carefully inspect every part of the document.

Please check the entire image carefully for any seals or stamps.

Output:
- State 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate if a seal or stamp or handwritten signature is present.

Does the provided image (e.g., invoice, receipt, delivery note) contain a handwritten signature or a seal/stamp?

**Methodology:**
1. **Mandatory Meticulous Scan:** You MUST perform a detailed, pixel-by-pixel scan of the entire document, including margins, blank spaces, and areas over printed text. Do not stop searching after a quick glance.

2. **Handwritten Signatures:**
    - Look for any evidence of a handwritten signature.
    - Ignore typed words that resemble a name.

3. **Seals or Stamps - Comprehensive Search:**
    - Actively search for faint, faded, smudged, blurry, or partially obscured markings.
    - These may appear as subtle changes in color, texture, or "ghosting" on the paper, even if the seal itself is not fully visible.
    - Check for upside-down, reversed, or partially cropped markings.

4. **Extreme Faintness Protocol:**
    - If no obvious seal is found, perform a second, more focused search.
    - Search for any pixel-level anomalies or subtle discolorations that could indicate a ghosted or extremely faded impression.
    - Prioritize finding any non-standard visual data on the paper's surface. A faint seal might appear as just a subtle shadow or a different shade of white.

5. **Final Verification:**
    - Before concluding, re-scan the entire document one last time to ensure no potential seals or signatures were overlooked.
    - Ignore any typed or printed text that resembles a name; only genuine handwritten signatures count.
    - Ignore the **Oasis logos** in the corners of the document.
    - Ignore any printed initials or names, even if they appear near the signature line.

**Output:**
- State 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate if a seal or stamp or handwritten signature is present.
- If 'Yes', provide a brief description and describe the location.
- A "No" should only be provided after a comprehensive and exhaustive search has found absolutely no evidence.

You are an expert document analysis AI. Your task is to meticulously examine the provided image of a document (e.g., invoice, receipt, delivery note) and determine if it contains any form of official seal, stamp, or handwritten signature.

Instructions:

Primary Objective: Locate any seals, stamps, or handwritten signatures on the document.

Look for All Types: These elements may be obvious or very challenging to detect. Pay extremely close attention to:

Seals or Stamps:
- Faint or faded markings: Seals or stamps applied with low ink or that have faded over time.
- Blurry or smudged imprints: Seals that are unclear due to movement or poor application.
- Obscured markings: Seals partially covered by text, signatures, folds, or other elements.
- Unusual orientations: Seals that are upside down, reversed, or partially cropped.
- Different colors or textures: Even light, dull, or faded seals that blend into the background.

Handwritten Signatures: 
- Only recognize genuine handwritten signatures. 
- Messy or unclear handwriting.
- Do NOT consider any typed, printed, or stamped text, initials, or names as a handwritten signature. 
- Ignore any printed initials or names, even if they appear near the signature line. 
- Handwritten signatures typically have irregular, cursive, or pen-written marks, and may show variations in ink thickness, slant, or pressure. 
- Handwritten signatures typically show variation in size, height, slant, thickness, and style, and do not match the uniform font or alignment of printed text. Only consider marks that clearly show these irregularities from the 'Signature Name' section as genuine handwritten signatures.

Scan All Areas: Seals and signatures may be located anywhere on the document — near the bottom, top, margins, or even over printed text. Carefully inspect every part of the document.

Output:

1. For Seals or Stamps:
- State 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate if a seal or stamp is present.
- If 'Yes', provide a brief description (e.g., 'A faint, blue, rectangular stamp', 'A clear, circular, red seal with an emblem').
- Describe the location (e.g., 'At the bottom, next to the salesperson's signature', 'Over the itemized list in the center of the page').

2. For Handwritten Signatures:
- State 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate if a handwritten signature is present.
- If 'Yes', provide a brief description (e.g., 'A messy, black ink signature', 'A partial, light pencil signature overlapping printed text').
- Describe the location (e.g., 'Below the customer details', 'Near the bottom margin').

Be thorough, observant, and objective in your assessment.

# Handwritten Signatures:
# - Messy or unclear handwriting.
# - Overlapping text or symbols.
# - Light, partial, or fragmented signatures that may look like scribbles.
# - Only recognize handwritten signatures; do not consider typed or printed text as a signature.
# - Ignore typed or printed names — only handwritten content counts.
